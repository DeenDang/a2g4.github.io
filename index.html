                    <h3>Deen Dang</h3>
                    <p>Deen Dang, s3859876, I was born in China; I came to Australia when I was about 11
                        years old and joined Australian citizenship in 2019. My hobbies are quite broad,
                        I like history, music (both classical and modern), 3D modelling stuff and little
                        bit of coding and travelling around (which still have not achieved). My interest
                        in IT is in 3 broad ways, first is game development, then the cybersecurity and
                        the last is software development. For game development, I like to play games, but
                        I enjoy more to create games that people can play and have fun with it. For
                        cybersecurity, my idea is to help protect people’s privacy and sensitive data from
                        leaking to hackers or scammer or other kinds of negative impact towards the user,
                        by doing this, I could create a safer environment when people browser through the
                        internet. And finally, the software development to me is having the same mindset
                        with the game development is that by creating software that could make people enjoy.
                         My current experience of IT is built PC systems, troubleshoot PCs, simple coding
                         (from uni study), and networking troubleshooting (also from uni study).   </p>

                    <h3>Minh Hoang Pham</h3>
                    <p>My name is Minh Hoang Pham. My student number is s3746869 and Student email address
                        is s3746869@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Vietnam and have come to Melbourne
                        Australia since 2019 for study at RMIT. I am 3rd year student. Vietnamese is my mother
                        tongue and English is my second language. In my free time, I often go fishing around
                        Melbourne and play soccer. My favourite soccer club is Manchester United. There is a
                        lot of major to explore in the computer and IT field of Interest including Gaming,
                        Artificial Intelligent, Mobile App, Web design, Cybersecurity and Database. But my
                        favourite thing is web development which is turning clients’ web concept design into
                        a full-fledged website. I started interesting in web developer 1 years ago. I love
                        that way of a website bring the message and imagine of people to life. The man who
                        sparked me to choose IT is Mark Zuckerberg since I watched the movie "The Social
                        Network" in 2019. </p>

                    <h3>Zeyi Li</h3>
                    <p>Zeyi Li, s3958095, nationality and culture: China; Keeping pets is one of my hobbies,
                        I have two cats and one dog make my life full of fun. I watched The Matrix when I was
                        a child, and then I thought the colourful computer code interface was too excellent,
                        so I wanted to be the kind of hacker who could be like the one in the movie. Although
                        I scratch my scalp stupidly facing a few lines of code every day, it will give me a
                        great sense of accomplishment after completing a program. Furthermore, my interest in
                        gaming has sparked my interest in IT. There are often many cheaters in some games, so
                        normal players have no game experience. I want to contribute to the anti-cheat program
                        in the future.  </p>

                    <h3>YiWei Lin</h3>
                    <p>My name is Yiwei Lin, and my English name is Luke, which is I chose from Bible. My student
                        number is s3838211 and my student email is s3838211@student.rmit.edu.au, my home country is
                        China, I was graduated from University High in Parkville. My mother language is mandarin
                        and keep learning English. I am interested in sleep, eat, play video game with others and
                         K-pop, I cannot live without those. I am interest in web programming now, after I study
                         java programming, database, security, I also interest in AI and networking, I will take
                         course in those fields. My project idea also may concern AI technique. To be honest, first
                         time I interest in IT is in year 10, we should think about what we should learn in university,
                         compare with science, arts, commerce and so on, I just prefer IT because it sounds like more
                         logical and a sense of modern. And I also feel IT is the trade of the future, for example,
                         cryptocurrencies are not only involved in IT but also in financial worlds. There are also
                         new energy vehicles that need to be used in the system of human-computer interaction is also
                         impacting the traditional automotive industry. </p>

                        in software development as I enjoy creating new projects and figuring out how to create better
                        iterations of these programs. </p>
